# Basic-Portfolio
### Create the templete for my "About", "Portfolio" and "Contact page"
 - I will set the three pages have the save Nav Bar, main background image and footer
 - I make 2 containers for the page templete. One is my name and nav bar, then other one is the About me, image and the paragraph.

### Technology:
 - HTML
 - CSS

One challenge for me is to find the right source of my main backgound image:
```CSS
.container1 {
    background-image: url(../Images/cloth.png);  
    background-repeat: repeat;
    margin-top: 34px;
    margin-left: 5px;
    border: 1px solid #cccccc
}
```
